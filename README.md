Hi, Iâ€™m @SPerezPerilla Iâ€™m interested in physics, mathematics, aircraft, programming (self-evident), design, mythology, women, etc...




Many say I lack focus; I partially agree, but I'd like to counter that I'm still in the process of refinement.


Iâ€™m currently learning how to make engineering tools using Excel/VBA, Python The Hard Way, Git, effective time management, and... how to talk to a stranger without coming off as an angry cynical android.




Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on... Nothing right now. I have some individual projects I want to start/finish, way too many.  
I don't have the requisite skills to effectively collaborate with strangers right now - but I am working on it.<br/>
Tell you what - Come to me with your project and If I feel capable of helping... I may. Keep in mind you're dealing with an arrogant, heartbroken, almost bottom-grade  	coder. Cynical android remember?




ðŸ“« How to reach me - s.perez.perilla@gmail.com - <!--- or maybe you can send me a letter with one of those magical letter-delivering birds I keep hearing about. Maybe we can figure out what makes them magic. Once we do, we can bind the bird population into the global economy, I don't like those free-loaders eating worms off of private land. /s ---><br/>
